# Detailed Source Code Analysis
- Static Code Analysis: The source code is scanned at both binary and source levels to identify potential violations of coding guidelines and security practices.
- Manual Code Review: The auditors manually review the code to identify logic flaws, integer overflows, race conditions, improper access controls, and other potential vulnerabilities.
- Third-Party Libraries and Dependencies: A thorough review of third-party libraries and dependencies is conducted to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.

# Vulnerability Identification and Verification
- Scan Results Verification: The initial scan results are reviewed to identify false positives and determine which findings can affect application security.
- Critical and High-Risk Vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities are prioritized and must be addressed immediately due to the significant threat they pose to the network, users, or critical infrastructure.
- Medium and Low-Risk Vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner and are typically more complex to exploit, requiring specific conditions or access.

# Recommendation and Mitigation
- Detailed Recommendations: For each identified vulnerability, specific recommendations are provided to mitigate the risk. This includes updating libraries, modifying code, and improving security practices.
- Continuous Monitoring: Recommendations for continuous monitoring and regular security audits by independent parties are provided to ensure ongoing security and resilience against emerging threats.

# Final Review and Report
- Comprehensive Report: A detailed audit report is compiled, summarizing the findings, recommendations, and the overall security posture of the Nexis Network blockchain.
- Verification of Fixes: After implementing the recommended fixes, a final review is conducted to ensure all vulnerabilities have been addressed adequately.

# Conclusion
- Security Assurance: The audit process concludes with a comprehensive understanding of the blockchain’s security, ensuring that the Nexis Network is robust, secure, and ready to support its users and stakeholders.

This rigorous audit process underscores Nexis Network's commitment to maintaining a secure, high-performance blockchain infrastructure, drawing on the best practices from leading projects such as Solana, Polygon zkEVM, Cosmos WASM, and Velas. The results of the audit process provide stakeholders with confidence in the security and reliability of the Nexis Network.
